                                <p>(a) by placing an order directly with a supplier (Supplier), specifying your GlobalParcelForward Address as the delivery address for the Goods; or</p>

                                <p>(c) by way of the Distribution Service (described in condition below 2.1.3 below).</p>
                                <p>Whenever we receive Goods at your GlobalParcelForward Address, we will contact you to arrange
                                the forwarding of those Goods to your Delivery Address

                                with a Supplier for specific Goods. We will purchase those Goods, arrange for delivery to your

                                <p>(The Distribution Service).</p>
                                <p>We will charge you a fee for using the Distribution Service (the Distribution Service Fee). You must
                                pay the full price of the Goods and the Distribution Service Fee before we can place the order with

                                those Goods to your Delivery Address using the Forwarding Service. Provided that you have
                                complied with condition 5, we will sell the Goods to you (and charge the Distribution Service Fee to
                                you) zero rated for UK VAT purposes.</p>
                                <p>Other Services</p>
                                <p>2.1.4 We offer a range of other supplementary services such as Combine and Repack, and Returns
                                Shipping for which we charge a fee. Details of these services and the fees we charge for them can be
                                found on the Site.</p>
                                <p>2.2 By registering as a Registered Member and using one or more of the Services above, you confirm
                                that your ultimate delivery address (to be specified by you when you become a Registered Member)
                                (your Delivery Address) is, in each instance, within one of the countries to which, according to the
                                Site, we are willing to send Goods (as may be amended by us in our sole discretion from time to
                                time).</p>
                                <p>2.3 We are only able to provide the Services where your Delivery Address is located outside of the
                                UK. If we receive Goods to be sent to a Delivery Address in the UK, we will dispose of the Goods as
                                we see fit and shall not be liable to you in any way. We cannot accept any order placed by way of the
                                Distribution Service where the Delivery Address is within the UK. Again, we shall not be liable to you
                                in any way in relation to those Goods</p>
                                <p>2.4 After you have become a Registered Member we will provide you with your unique GlobalParcelForward Address.</p>
                                <p>2.5 As a Registered Member, you will be responsible for all Goods sent to your GlobalParcelForward
                                Address, even if another person is using your GlobalParcelForward Address. We will assume that any
                                Goods we receive from a Supplier to your GlobalParcelForward Address have been ordered by you
                                for us to forward to your Delivery Address (under the Forwarding Service). Therefore, you should be
                                careful not to pass on details relating to your membership of the Site to anyone that is not
                                authorised to arrange for Goods to be sent to your GlobalParcelForward Address.
                                </p>
                                <p>2.6 You can cease to be a Registered Member at any time by navigating to the "My Account" page of
                                the Site and selecting the option to close your account.

                                <p>The terms set out in this condition 3 apply to all Services that we offer.</p>
                                <p>3.1 If you place an order for Goods directly with a Supplier, you must provide your GlobalParcelForward Address as the address to which the Supplier should send those Goods.</p>
                                <p>3.2 We are only able to receive Goods between 0800hrs and 1800hrs Monday to Friday (London, UK,
                                time). When you place an order for Goods directly with a Supplier, you will need to tell the Supplier
                                this. We will not be liable to you for any Goods delivered outside those hours.</p>
                                <p>3.3 Unless you have requested and received prior written consent from us we will only accept
                                delivery of Goods from Suppliers based in the UK and European Union. Any Goods that we receive
                                from any other location, without prior consent, will either be rejected or disposed of as we see fit.
                                We shall not be liable to you in relation to those Goods.</p>
                                <p>3.4 In placing an order with us, you confirm that the Goods have been purchased from a retailer that
                                is authorised to sell the Goods in the country in which you are based. You also confirm that if the

                                country in which you are based.</p>
                                <p>3.5 Acceptance of your request for us to provide Services to you in accordance with these Terms of Trade shall take place:</p>
                                <p>3.5.1 if you placed an order directly with a Supplier specifying your GlobalParcelForward Address as
                                the delivery address for the Goods, when we dispatch your Goods to your Delivery Address by way of the Forwarding Service; or</p>
                                <p>3.5.2 if you are using the Personal Shopper Service, when we have received the full price payable for the Goods and the Personal Shopper Service Fee for those Goods; or</p>
                                <p>3.5.3 if you are using the Distribution Service, when we have received the full price payable for the
                                Goods and the Distribution Service Fee for those Goods.</p>
                                <p>3.6 Subject to conditions 3.2 and 3.3 above, risk in the Goods will pass to us on the date we receive
                                the Goods. Risk in the Goods will pass to the Courier (as defined in condition 3.8 below) on the date we pass the Goods to the Courier.</p>
                                <p>Title in the Goods will pass in accordance with the following:</p>
                                <p>Order Placed with Supplier</p>
                                <p>3.6.1 Title in the Goods shall remain with the Supplier until you make payment in full for those Goods to the Supplier, at which point title will pass to you.</p>
                                <p>Personal Shopper Service</p>
                                <p>3.6.2 title in the Goods shall remain with the Supplier until we make payment in full for those Goods
                                on your behalf, at which point, provided we have already received payment in full for those Goods
                                from you, title will pass to you.</p>
                                <p>Distribution Service</p>
                                <p>3.6.3 Title in the Goods shall remain with the Supplier until we make payment in full for those
                                Goods, at which point title will pass to us. Title in the Goods will pass from us to you once we have received payment in full for the entire Fee (as defined in condition 9.2 below).</p>
                                <p>3.7 After we have received the Goods we will process them through our warehouse. While
                                processing the Goods through our warehouse we may need to inspect the Goods, which could
                                include opening packages where necessary. If we do this, we will re-package the Goods so they are packaged to a similar standard to when we received them. Although we will use reasonable
                                endeavours to avoid doing so, you acknowledge that as part of this inspection we may have to break
                                the seals on some Goods. We do not accept any liability for any damage caused as a result (unless it
                                is due to our negligence).
                                </p>
                                <p>3.8 All Goods will be delivered to your Delivery Address by way of the Forwarding Service by a courier appointed by us (the Courier).</p>
                                <p>3.9 In certain limited circumstances (such as where we receive Prohibited Goods or Restricted
                                Goods, as defined in conditions 6.1 and 6.2 below) we may, where we think it is reasonable, refuse
                                to provide the Services in relation to Goods we receive from a Supplier. If this happens we will return
                                the Goods to that Supplier.</p>
                                <p>3.10 In the event that we take delivery of Goods arriving from outside the European Union there
                                may be import duty, VAT and other fees payable to the delivering courier and UK authorities. You
                                authorise us to pay such duties, taxes and fees on your behalf and agree that you will reimburse us
                                immediately for all such costs upon presentation of our invoice for the same.</p>
                                <p>3.11 You indemnify us in respect of all costs and liabilities arising from taking delivery of your Goods,including responsible disposal of them if required, regardless of whether we subsequently forward those Goods to you or not.</p>

                                <p>4.4 We may refuse to accept any order placed by you for the Personal Shopper Service in our
                                absolute discretion (including, without limitation, where the Goods do not comply with the
                                requirements set out in these Terms of Trade).</p>
                                <p>4.5 When placing an order for us to provide the Personal Shopper Service, you:</p>
                                <p>4.5.1 Acknowledge that if we place an order on your behalf we do so as your agent;</p>
                                <p>4.5.2 acknowledge that we do not accept any liability in relation to any Goods we order, except to
                                  the extent expressly set out in these Terms of Trade and that, if the Goods are faulty, you will
                                  contact the Supplier and/or manufacturer of the Goods directly and not us; and </p>
                                <p>4.5.3 Agree that we may, at our option, obtain identical Goods from an alternative Supplier to your
                                  nominated Supplier (provided that the price charged by that alternative Supplier is the same or less
                                  than the price charged by your nominated Supplier). We are not required to pass on to you any cost
                                  savings or commission we gain as a result of obtaining the Goods from an alternative Supplier in this
                                  way.</p>
                                <p>4.6 By placing an order for the Personal Shopper Service, we will assume that you also wish us to
                                  provide the Forwarding Service as set out in these Terms of Trade.</p>
                                <p>4.7 Before we can accept your order for the Personal Shopper Service, we will contact your
                                  nominated Supplier to confirm the correct price of the Goods and their availability. If the Goods can
                                  only be sourced with that Supplier at a higher price than you have specified, we will try to identify an
                                  alternative Supplier in accordance with condition 4.5.3 above. If we are unable to identify an
                                  alternative Supplier, we will contact you to confirm (a) the price at which the Goods may be sourced
                                  from your nominated Supplier; and (b) the identity of an alternative Supplier and the price at which
                                  identical Goods may be sourced from that Supplier. We will not place any order with an alternative
                                  Supplier until you have confirmed to us that you are happy for us to do so. If the Goods are
                                  unavailable, we will notify you and cancel your order.</p>
                                <p>4.8 We must receive the full price payable for the Goods together with the Personal Shopper Service
                                  Fee before we can accept your order. We will, in our discretion either:</p>
                                <p>4.8.1 require you to pay the price payable for the Goods and the Personal Shopper Service Fee at the
                                  time you place your order (this amount will be refunded if we do not accept your order); or</p>
                                <p>4.8.2 send you an invoice by e-mail for the price payable for the Goods and the Personal Shopper
                                  Service Fee.</p>
                                <p>4.9 Following receipt of the full price payable for the Goods and the Personal Shopper Service Fee,
                                  we will place an order for the Goods as soon as reasonably practicable.</p>
                                <p>Personal Shopper Refunds</p>
                                <p>4.10 If the Goods cannot be supplied by the Supplier and we cannot find an alternative supplier at
                                  the same or lower price we will inform you and make arrangements to refund the cost of the Goods
                                  via the same payment method you used to pay us net of any transactions costs (for example costs in
                                  making an international bank transfer).</p>
                                <p>4.11 If the Goods are delivered damaged at our warehouse or, using commercially reasonable
                                  efforts, it is apparent without opening the packaging that the Goods are not as described or
                                  specified in the order made with the Supplier we will contact you for further instructions. If the
                                  Supplier will accept a return and you instruct us to return the Goods and seek a refund we will,
                                  subject to condition 6.9, attempt to return the Goods and obtain a refund in accordance with the
                                  Supplier's terms. We will endeavour to refund to you whatever sum is recovered from the Supplier
                                  net of any costs incurred (such as return shipping costs, Supplier restocking fees, or transaction
                                  costs) within 14 days of receiving it ourselves. You agree that if we are unable, using commercially
                                  reasonable efforts, to obtain a refund from the Supplier we will have no liability to you whatsoever.</p>
                                <p>4.12 If after you have received the Goods you wish to return them because they are faulty or not as
                                  described or specified in the order made with the Supplier contact us and we will use commercially
                                  reasonable efforts, subject to condition 6.9, to obtain agreement from the Supplier to accept a
                                  return. If the Supplier agrees to accept a return you will need to arrange to ship the Goods back to us
                                  at your expense. We will endeavour to refund to you whatever sum is recovered from the Supplier
                                  net of any costs incurred (such as return shipping costs within the UK, Supplier restocking fees, or
                                  transaction costs) within 14 days of receiving it ourselves. You agree that if we are unable, using
                                  commercially reasonable efforts, to obtain a refund from the Supplier we will have no liability to you
                                  whatsoever.</p>

                                <p>8.1 We will aim to ensure that all Goods which we receive at your GlobalParcelForward Address are forwarded to your Delivery Address (by way of the Forwarding Service) as soon as possible after receiving your instructions and payment to do so. Goods will normally be forwarded within 48 hours of payment, although it may take longer where we, acting reasonably, suspect that Restricted Goods or Prohibited Goods have been sent to us, or that the Goods may be fraudulent or otherwise unsuitable for export. Delivery times for the Forwarding Service vary according to your DeliveryAddress and the Courier you select, but should take no longer than 10 business days (excluding time spent in customs which is beyond our control) from the date on which we dispatch the Goods to you. Deliveries may require your signature to confirm receipt.</p>
                                <p>8.2 We may, prior to dispatching the Goods to your Delivery Address (by way of the Forwarding Service) and in our discretion, contact you to offer you the option of receiving the Forwarding Service by way of a low cost or pallet based service as opposed to a normal Courier. Where you agree to receiving the Forwarding Service in this way, we will agree with you an alternative Forwarding Fee before we dispatch the Goods to your Delivery Address. When using this low cost or pallet based service, your delivery time should not exceed 30 business days. We will not accept any liability for the loss, damage or destruction of Goods after they have been delivered to you.</p>
                                <p>8.3 We will store Goods which we receive at your GlobalParcelForward Address for up to 30 days without charge whilst we await your instructions to ship and your payment for the Forwarding Service. After this time we will charge a daily storage fee for each package we have stored beyond 30 days. The fee for each package will accrue daily until the package is shipped or disposed of. The fee we charge for storage is set out on the Site or in an email we send you before the charge is incurred.</p>

                                <p>9.1 Before you place an order with a Supplier for delivery to your GlobalParcelForward Address, we suggest that you use the calculator on the Site to obtain an indicative price for us providing the Forwarding Service to you.</p>
                                <p>9.2 The full fee that you must pay to us for each order (the Fee) shall comprise:</p>
                                <p>9.2.1 the cost of the Goods ordered (which shall be zero where you have placed an order directly with a Supplier and have already paid the Supplier for those Goods); and</p>

                                <P>9.3 The Personal Shopper Service Fee and Distribution Service Fee shall each be set out on the Site from time to time.</P>
                                <P>9.4 The Forwarding Fee will be agreed with you before we send the Goods to your Delivery Address.The Forwarding Fee will be dependent upon (i) the charges made by the Courier and (ii) the size and weight of the package as measured and determined by us when we receive the Goods from the Supplier at your GlobalParcelForward Address.</P>
                                <P>9.5 All prices on the Site are in pounds (£) sterling. Prices may change at any time. Where you place an order with us for the Distribution Service, we shall, provided that you comply with your obligations in condition 5, deliver the Goods to you (and charge the Distribution Service Fee to you) zero rated for UK VAT purposes.</P>
                                <p>9.6 Whenever we receive Goods at your GlobalParcelForward Address, we will contact you using the details you provided when you became a Registered Member (or subsequently) to confirm the full amount of the Fee and to take payment from you using your payment card (a Direct Payment). If we are unable to contact you in order to make a Direct Payment, or you are unable to make a Direct Payment for any reason, we will promptly send to you an invoice for the amount of the Fee (an Invoice Payment). For the avoidance of doubt, we will not dispatch the Goods to you until we have received full payment for the Goods and the entire Fee.</p>
                                <p>9.7 If we are unable to contact you within 10 business days of receiving Goods from a Supplier at your GlobalParcelForward Address, we may return the Goods to that Supplier.</p>
                                <p>9.8 You are responsible for the Courier’s costs where:</p>
                                <p>9.8.1 we return any Goods to you;</p>
                                <p>9.8.2 we return any Goods to the Supplier; or</p>
                                <p>9.8.3 any Goods are returned to us because you are not available or refuse to accept delivery of those Goods at the Delivery Address on the date of attempted delivery by the Courier.</p>
                                <p>9.9 Where, under condition 9.8 above, you are required to pay Courier costs, we will contact you so you may make a Direct Payment for those costs.</p>
                                <p>9.10 All payment card holders are subject to validation checks and authorisation by the card issuer. If the issuer of your payment card refuses to authorise payment we will not be able to send your Goods, will not be obliged to inform you of the reason for the refusal and we will not be liable for non-delivery. In these circumstances we will try to contact you again to obtain valid payment details. If you do not provide a successful Direct Payment promptly we will deal with the Goods as we see fit.</p>
                                <p>9.11 We are not responsible for your card issuer or bank charging you as a result of our processing of your Direct Payment.</p>

This means that your credit/debit card details are provided directly to the payment merchant and are never revealed to us. The payment merchant shall operate a secure server to process your payment details. The payment merchant shall encrypt your credit/debit card information and shall authorise payment.</p>
                                <p>9.13 Refunds and cancellations: You cannot cancel a shipping order you have made once your shipment has been booked by us with the Courier; in such cases no refunds can be made.

                                <p>12.1 If you wish to make a complaint please contact us by email or telephone and we will seek to
                                  resolve any problem fairly. Please see "13 How to contact us" in these Terms of Trade. If, having
                                  given us reasonable time to address your complaint you are not satisfied with our response please
                                  write to the "Head of Operations" at our registered address (see "13 How to contact us") with details

                                <p>12.2 Alternative dispute resolution is a process where an independent body considers the facts of a
                                  dispute and seeks to resolve it, without you having to go to court. If your country of residence is
                                  within the EU and if, having written to our Head of Operations and given us 30 days to resolve your
                                  complaint you are still not satisfied with how we have responded, you may submit a complaint via
                                  the European Commission Online Dispute Resolution platform at http://ec.europa.eu/odr.</p>
