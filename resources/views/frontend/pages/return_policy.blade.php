                      <p>1.1 Most products will be delivered by UPS (United Parcel Service), FX World, TNT, ParcelForce, DPD or Nightline.</p>
                      <p>1.2 If we are unable to contact you within 10 business days of receiving Goods from a Supplier at your GlobalParcelForward Address, we may return the Goods to that Supplier.</p>
                      <p>1.3 We will aim to ensure that all Goods which we receive at your GlobalParcelForward Address are forwarded to your Delivery Address (by way of the Forwarding Service) as soon as
                        possible after receiving your instructions and payment to do so. Goods will normally be
                        forwarded within 48 hours of payment, although it may take longer where we, acting
                        reasonably, suspect that Restricted Goods or Prohibited Goods have been sent to us, or that
                        the Goods may be fraudulent or otherwise unsuitable for export. Delivery times for the
                        Forwarding Service vary according to your Delivery Address and the Courier you select, but
                        should take no longer than 10 business days (excluding time spent in customs which is
                        beyond our control) from the date on which we dispatch the Goods to you. Deliveries may
                        require your signature to confirm receipt.</p>

                        with the Courier; in such cases no refunds can be made. Refunds of shipping costs and
                        compensation for Goods that are lost or damaged either in our care or during transit with a
                        tracked Courier service will be treated in accordance with condition 10 of the <b>Terms of Trade.</b>
                        No compensation or refunds of shipping costs will be made under any circumstances in respect
                        of, regular mail, budget and untracked Courier services.</p>

                          your account, and no other cost will be incurred by us returning your goods to the supplier, we
                          will refund your money within one week following when payment is received. If possible,
                          refunds will be made in the same way as your original payment.</p>
